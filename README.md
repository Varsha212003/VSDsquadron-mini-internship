# VSDsquadron-mini-internship
The vsdsquadron mini is a RISC-V development board.The board has 15 GPIO pins and supports protocols such as I2C, SPI, and USART. In this internship we learn about the RISC-V architecturre and explore the capabilities of a RISC-V mircoprocessor using the vsdsquadron mini. We also build a project around the vsdsquadron mini.
